nao_moveit_config: Tutorial
==========================

This tutorial introduce how to use moveit to plan and execute trajectories on aldebaran's NAO robots.

Requirements
============
It's highly recommended to have the following packages installed on your system before running nao_moveit_config:

To simulate nao on moveit only:
* nao_description : explicit dependency

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-nao-description

or clone the repo in your workspace

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone git@github.com:ros-nao/nao_robot.git
	cd ..
	catkin_make

* nao_meshes : you need this package to properly display the robot in RVIZ

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-nao-meshes

Note : you need to accept the license in the terminal for the package to be installed

You can easily check if the meshes have been successfully installed by running : 

.. code-block:: bash

	roslaunch nao_description display_generated.launch

If the meshes are installed you should see : 


.. image:: display_with_meshes.png
   :width: 100%

Otherwise either you have a lot of error messages and RVIZ doesn't display anything, either you have the following image

Launch Moveit Rviz plugin
=======================

Without robot
-------------
You can run this moveit package either unconnected to any robot or attached to a robot (real or simulated):
For a standalone execution :

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch nao_moveit_config demo.launch

On a real nao
--------------
To launch it on a real nao you need:
   - nao_dcm (https://github.com/ros-aldebaran/nao_dcm_robot)
   - nao_control (https://github.com/ros-aldebaran/nao_virtual)

First set NAO_IP environment variable to your robot PI address

Modify the bringup configuration file : nao_dcm_bringup/config/nao_dcm.yaml 

Set the rosparam "RobotIP" to your Nao's IP address

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch nao_dcm_bringup nao_dcm_H25_bringup_remote.launch
    
Wait until nao_dcm_bringup is ready then run:

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch nao_moveit_config moveit_planner.launch


On a simulated nao (in gazebo)
-----------------------------
To launch it on a gazebo simulated nao you need : 
   - nao_dcm (https://github.com/ros-aldebaran/nao_dcm_robot)
   - nao_control (https://github.com/ros-aldebaran/nao_virtual)
   - nao_gazebo_plugin (https://github.com/ros-aldebaran/nao_virtual)

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch nao_dcm_gazebo nao_dcm_gazebo_H25.launch
    
Wait until nao_gazebo is ready then click on the play button in gazebo.

Finally run:

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch nao_moveit_config moveit_planner.launch

This is based on the work of Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis: https://github.com/costashatz/nao_dcm.


Use Moveit
==========
All the following screenshots have been done by launching demo.launch. Everything should be the same for the other use cases, except the position of the robot at launchtime.

.. image:: moveit_launch.png
   :width: 100%

First check the box "Allow approximate IK Solutions" on the bottom of the left column.

.. image:: allow_approximate.png
   :width: 100%

Go to the planning tab

.. image:: planningTab.png
   :width: 100%

You can chose the part of the robot you want to move by setting the planning group

.. image:: planningGroup.png
   :width: 100%

Move your robot by drag and dropping the interactive markers.
- translate the end-effector by moving the arrows
- rotate the end effector by moving along the circles
- move the group by moving the blue sphere

.. image:: moveMarkers.png
   :width: 100%

To compute the trajectory you click on the Plan button

.. image:: plan.png
   :width: 100%

Once the motion is satisfying you can try it on your real robot using 'execute' which is enabled only after a successful planning

Now you noww everything to play with nao_moveit_config
